**COURSE DESCRIPTION**

Join me as I teach this free 10-week reinforcement learning course I’ve called Move 37.

I’ll take you on a journey through the basics up to modern day techniques. Every week, we’ll build apps together that will cover both toy and industry problems. You’ll be able to measure your progress along the way by chatting with your peers both online and offline at the School of AI chapters globally, taking quizzes, coding challenges, and 2 graded projects. I’ll have weekly coding live streams to help answer any questions, and my assistant instructors will be available to help in our community slack channel.

**CERTIFICATION**

Students who successfully complete the course will receive their own certificate signed by Siraj Raval.

**LEARNING OUTCOMES**

Technologies we will use:
* Pytorch
* OpenAI Gym
* Google Collaborator
* TensorFlow
