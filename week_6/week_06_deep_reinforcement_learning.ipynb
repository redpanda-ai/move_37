    "\n",
    "### Question 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a feed forward network with one hidden layer, an activation function, and as many hidden units as we need, which of the following statments are true?\n",
    "    - [x] This network can approximate any continuous function (to an arbitrary level of precision)\n",
    "    - [ ] This network can approximate any linear function (to an arbitrary level of precision)\n",
    "    - [ ] This network can approximate any function (to an arbitrary level of precision)\n",
    "    - [x] This network can approximate a nonlinear function\n",
    "    \n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The universality approximation theorem allows our hypothetical network to approximate any continuous function.  The activation function makes our model robust to non-linearity.\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Question 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Which of the following tasks are suited to an RNN?\n",
    "    - [ ] Image classification\n",
    "    - [x] Image captioning\n",
    "    - [x] Sentiment analysis\n",
    "    - [x] Machine translation\n",
    "    \n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Image classification is best left to the CNN architecture.  Image captioning is a fixed input, variable size output problem.  Sentiment analysis is a variable input, fixed size output problem.  Machine translation is a variable input, variable size output problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 3\n",
    "\n",
    "Which of the following statements are true about the LSTM?\n",
    "\n",
    "    - [ ] LSTMs were first developed in 2006\n",
    "    - [x] LSTMs were first developed in the late 90s\n",
    "    - [ ] The input gate controls how much to write to a cell\n",
    "    - [x] The input gate controls whether to write to a cell\n",
    "    \n",
    "**Explanation**\n",
    "\n",
    "The LSTM architecture was first developed in 1997.  The i-gate controls whether to write to a cell, while the g-gate controls how much to write.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 4\n",
    "\n",
    "Which of the following statements are true about the GRU architecture?\n",
    "\n",
    "    - [x] The GRU is simpler than the LSTM\n",
    "    - [x] The GRU uses the 'reset' gate to allow forgetting the previous state\n",
    "    - [ ] The GRU uses extra hidden units\n",
    "    - [x] The GRU uses the 'update' gate to modulate between the current and candidate activations\n",
    "    \n",
    "**Explanation**\n",
    "\n",
    "For information concerning the GRU be sure to check out this very informative [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYRIOGTPRPU) by Andrew Ng\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 5\n",
    "\n",
    "Which of the following statements are true about vanishing/exploding gradients?\n",
    "\n",
    "    - [x] Backpropogation through time can lead to vanishing/exploding gradients\n",
    "    - [x] RNNs can develop problems with vanishing/exploding gradients\n",
    "    - [x] gradient clipping is a simple hack for vanishing/exploding gradients\n",
    "    - [x] LSTMs and GRUs help to mitigate problems with vanishing/exploding gradients\n",
    "    \n",
    "**Explanation**\n",
